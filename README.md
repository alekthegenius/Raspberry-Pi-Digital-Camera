# Raspberry-Pi-Digital-Camera
Software to turn a Raspberry Pi into a Digital Camera

In this repository, there are three files, "gui.py", "startCam.sh", and "Cam.conf". The "gui.py" is a Python App for taking pictures and videos, "startCam.sh" is a program to start the "gui.py", and lastly, "Cam.conf" is a script that autostarts the "startCam.sh" program on boot, which in turn starts "gui.py".
