## Introduction

I have always had a passion for photography, and so in this instructable, I will describe how I created my own Raspberry Pi Digital Camera.

I began creating this digital camera with 3 objectives:

* To have a small lightweight camera
* To make it unique
* To have full control over the camera settings, ISO, Shutter Speed, etc.
To fulfill my objectives, I first designed the camera case to be round, which reduces the size and weight of the camera, while also giving it a sleek, modern look. Using Python 3 and Tkinter, I also programmed an app to allow for full manual control over the camera settings and features.

In this instructable, I will outline the materials used, the design process, the steps to follow, as well as some improvements for the future.

**Let's dive in!**

## Supplies

### Tools

* 3D Printer
* PETG Filament
* Screwdriver

### Materials

* Raspberry Pi Zero W or Zero 2 W
* CS-Mount Lens (I used an adjustable wide-angle lens from Pimoroni)
* Pimoroni Hyperpixel 2.1" Round Touch Display
* Raspberry Pi HQ Camera
* 15cm Raspberry Pi Zero to Camera Ribbon Cable
* Short Pi Standoffs Kit (Available from Pimoroni)
* M3x6mm Screws x12
* M3 Female to Female Standoff 10mm x4
* M3 Female to Male Standoff 5mm x4
* Right Angle Micro USB Male to Female Cable
* Micro USB to USB Cable
* Portable Battey Pack
* (Optional) Tripod to Hold Camera

## Designing the Camera Case

For the design process, I used Fusion 360 to sketch out a case for the Raspberry Pi and the camera to mount to. The purpose of the case is to provide protection for the touch screen and camera.
